File encryption, decryption, and hashing are important techniques used in computer security to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access, modification, or theft. 

Here's an overview of each:

File Encryption:
Encryption is the process of converting plaintext data into ciphertext, which is unreadable without a decryption key. 
File encryption is a technique of encrypting the entire contents of a file or data to prevent unauthorized access. 
There are two types of encryption techniques: symmetric-key encryption and public-key encryption.

File Decryption:
Decryption is the process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext using a decryption key. 
The process of file decryption is to convert the encrypted data back to its original form so that it can be used.

Hashing:
Hashing is the process of converting data of any size into a fixed-size string of characters. 
The resulting string of characters is called a hash or message digest. 
The hash function is a one-way function, meaning that it is easy to compute the hash value from the original data, but it is impossible to obtain the original data from the hash value.

In our project, we've already provided a HTML file that satisfies the necessatites demanded. In the upcoming weeks, we'll be trying to develope more the code and add any other features needed.
